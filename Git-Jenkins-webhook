# Step 1: Configure a Webhook in Bitbucket

In your Bitbucket repository, go to "Settings" > "Webhooks."
Click on "Add webhook."
Fill in the following details:
Title: Give your webhook a descriptive title.
URL: Enter the URL of your Jenkins server's webhook endpoint. The URL format typically looks like this: http://jenkins-server:port/bitbucket-hook/.
Status: Select "Active" to enable the webhook.
Triggers: Choose "Pull request created" and "Pull request updated" to trigger the webhook whenever a PR is created or updated.
Repository: Select the repository for which you want to configure the webhook.
Click "Save" to create the webhook in Bitbucket.

Step 2: Configure a Commit Event Webhook for the Master Branch in Bitbucket

In your Bitbucket repository, go to "Settings" > "Webhooks."
Click on "Add webhook."
Fill in the following details for the commit event webhook:
Title: Give your webhook a descriptive title.
URL: Enter the URL of your Jenkins server's webhook endpoint (the same URL you used for the PR event webhook).
Status: Select "Active" to enable the webhook.
Triggers: Choose "Push" as the trigger event.
Branches: Under "Choose the branches this will apply to," select "Repository has at least one branch matching."
In the "Branch pattern" field, enter master. This ensures that the webhook is triggered only when commits are pushed to the master branch.
Click "Save" to create the commit event webhook in Bitbucket.

# Step 3: Set Up a Jenkins Job

In Jenkins, create or configure a Jenkins job for your project. This job should be set up to build and test your code when triggered by Bitbucket PR events/master push.
In the job configuration, under "Build Triggers," select "Generic Webhook Trigger."
Configure the webhook trigger settings:
Token: Generate a secret token and enter it here. This token will be used to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.
Project Name: Specify the project name or a regular expression pattern for matching Bitbucket repository names.
Trigger on descendent jobs: If you have downstream jobs that need to be triggered, enable this option.
Define the steps in your Jenkins job that you want to execute when the webhook is triggered. These steps should include building, testing, and any other actions you want to perform on PR events.
Save the job configuration.
