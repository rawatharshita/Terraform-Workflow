Step 1: Set Up Bitbucket Webhooks

In your Bitbucket repository, go to "Settings" > "Webhooks" > "Add webhook."
Set the "Title" and "URL" for your webhook. The URL should point to your Jenkins server's webhook URL. It will typically be in the format: http://jenkins-server:port/bitbucket-hook/.
Under "Triggers," select "Repository > Push" to trigger the webhook on code pushes.
Save the webhook configuration.


STEP-2: Install Required Jenkins Plugins

You'll need the following Jenkins plugins:

Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin: This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Bitbucket repositories and handle webhooks.
Pipeline Plugin: This plugin enables Jenkins Pipeline jobs using a Jenkinsfile.
Terraform Plugin

STEP- 2: Configure to provide path where terraform is installed on server

System configuration ---> Global tool configuration 
Under Terraform tab: either install automatically or innstall the Terraform on server and provide the terraform executable path here.
